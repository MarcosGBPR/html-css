        <p>Knight Artorias was one of the four Knights of Gwyn, the commanding knights of Lord Gwyn's army. Artorias had an unbendablewill of steel, which both helped and fed his hatred for servants of the Dark, particularly the Darkwraiths of Kaathe.</p>
        <h2>Black Dragon Kalameet</h2>
        <p>Black Dragon Kalameet is the last of the ancient dragons and bringer of calamity. Even Anor Londo feared to provoke hiswrath.</p>

        <h2>Sunlight Straight Sword</h2>
        <p>This standard longsword, belonging to Solaire of Astora, is of high quality, is well-forged, and has been kept in good repair. Easy to use and dependable, but unlikely to live up to its grandiose name.</p>
        <h2>Greatsword of Artorias</h2>
        <p>Sword born from the soul of the great grey wolf Sif, guardian of the grave of the Abysswalker Knight Artorias. Sir Artorias hunted the Darkwraiths, and his sword strikes harder against dark servants.</p>
        <h2>Demon Great Machete</h2>
        <p>The lesser Capra demons use these greatswords in pairs. The blade is cast iron and hooked. The sword is imbued with no particular magic, but for those who have the strength, its great weight will smash foes mercilessly.</p>
        <h2>Uchigatana</h2>
        <p>Katana forged in an Eastern land. Known for its brisk slashing motions. The Uchigatana cuts beautifully and causes bleeding, but its blade is easily nicked.</p>
        <h2>Gravelord Sword</h2>
        <p>Sword wielded only by servants of Gravelord Nito, the first of the dead. Crafted from the bones of the fallen. The miasma of death exudes from the sword, a veritable toxin to any living being.</p>
        <h2>Black Knight Greataxe</h2>
        <p>Greataxe of the Black Knights who wander Lordran. Used to face Chaos demons. The large motion that puts the weight of the body into the attack reflects the great size of their adversaries long ago.</p>
        <h2>Demon's Great Hammer</h2>

        <h2>Dragonslayer Spear</h2>
        <p>Cross spear born from the soul of Ornstein, a Dragonslayer guarding Anor Londo cathedral. Inflicts lightning damage; effective against dragons. Two-handed thrust relies on cross and buries deep within a dragon's hide, and sends human foes flying.</p>
        <h2>Lifehunt Scythe</h2>
        <p>Scythe born from the soul of Priscilla, the stark white crossbreed trapped inside the painted world of Ariamis. Even the Gods feared Priscilla's lifehunt ability, and in the hands of a mortal, its power will turn upon its wielder.</p>
        <h2>Black Bow of Pharis</h2>
        <p>The preferred black bow of the heroic archer Pharis. Has a longer range than standard bows, but is more difficult to use. Without proper abilities, results will be underwhelming.</p>
        <h2>Avelyn</h2>
        <p>Repeating crossbow cherished by the weapon craftsman Eidas. Its elaborate design makes it closer to a work of art than a weapon. Intricate mechanism makes heavy damage possible through triple-shot firing of bolts. but in fact each bolt inflicts less damage.</p>
        <h2>Logan's Catalyst</h2>
        <p>Catalyst of Big Hat Logan, the great sorcerer and seeker of knowledge. Originally the same catalyst employed by the Vinheim sorcerers, only terribly strengthened over time due to Logan's use. Very powerful when used by one of superior intelligence.</p>

        <p>Medium for casting miracles of the Gods. Granted to Darkmoon Blade knights, adherents to the Covenant of the Dark Sun Gwyndolin This talisman demands dutiful faith from its owner, but has very high miracle adjustment.</p>

        <H2>Velstadt, the Royal Aegis</H2>
        <P>Velstadt was always at the King's side, as if he were his lord's own shadow. After the King retired to the Undead Crypt, Velstadt followed, never to return.</P>

        <p>Sir Alonne came to this land from the east, chose to serve a little -known and unestablished lord, and helped him become the Old Iron King. Then, at the very peak of his sire's rule, Sir Alonne set out again, in search of land yet unknown.</p>

        <p>Ultra Greatsword of the Pursuer. Known as the mightiest of the straight swords, it demands great strength and dexterity of its wielder. The Pursuer hunts down those branded by the curse, as if each Undead soul that he claims will atone one of his sins.</p>
        <h2>Arced Sword</h2>
        <p>A curved greatsword forged from the soul of the Flexile Sentry. There is something unsettling, and at the same time beautiful, about its long curved blade. The sentry crammed inmates of the overflowing Bastille onto a rickety ship, and cast them out to the open sea. The majority of them drowned or starved but a few hardy survivors made land to the south, and imparted their knowledge of sorcery to the people there.</p>
        <h2>Darkdrift</h2>

        <h2>Gyrm Greataxe</h2>
        <p>A greataxe used by the nomadic Gyrm. At first glance this greataxe appears crude, but with further examination one sees the fine craftsmanship of Gyrm blacksmiths. Quite heavy for a human, but swung about with reckless abandon by the Gyrm.</p>
        <h2>Drakekeeper's Great Hammer</h2>
        <p>An extremely sturdy pitch-black great hammer. Colossal warriors staunchly watch over the shrine, ready to defend its resident, or allow one worthy enough to be granted audience.</p>
        <h2>Bone Fist</h2>
        <p>Bone that is bound to the fist. Used to enhance hand-to-hand combat. Salvaged from a malformed creature. Enables one to fight with inhuman strength, as if the very spirit of the bone's malicious owner had taken control.</p>
        <h2>Santier's Spear</h2>
        <p>A spear that was embedded in a stone statue. According to an old local legend, a great spear was used to defeat Santier, the walking statue. Perhaps this is that very spear. But it will be difficult to utilize such a thing in the manner of a spear. Your only choice is to swing it around, and smite foes about the head.</p>
        <h2>Scythe of The Forlorn</h2>
        <p>Scythe of the Forlorn, who wander the land of the Undead. The King's elder brother Aldia sought to overcome the curse through means unalike his sibling's. The Forlorn were born of Aldia's sinful infatuation.</p>

        <p>A twinblade with heavy blades on each end. More suited to smashing foes than slashing them. Requires a great deal of muscle to wield artfully. The twinblade closely imitates the design of a foreign-made weapon that has the blades affixed to both ends of its hilt.</p>
        <h2>Twin-Headed Greatbow</h2>
        <p>A greatbow made of animal bone. The fine craftmanship suggests that it originates in Lanafir. The unusual design appears to have ceremonial implications, but may simply be intended to intimidate foes.</p>
        <h2>Sunset Staff</h2>
        <p>A staff said to have been forged in Aldia. A catalyst for sorceries and hexes. Particularly powerful for casting hexes.

        <h2>Dragon Chime</h2>
        <p>A sacred chime shaped as a dragon. A catalyst for miracles and hexes. This chime sat long in the Dark Chasm, but still one senses a sublime purity. Only those with the deepest faith can wield this chime, but they will be rewarded with greatly amplified spells.</p>

        <h2>Moonlight Greatsword</h2>
        <p>Legendary dragon weapon associated with Seath the paledrake. Oceiros, the Consumed King, was infatuated with the search for moonlight, but in the end, it never revealed itself to him.</p>
